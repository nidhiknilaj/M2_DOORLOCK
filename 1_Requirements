Introduction The main goal of this project was to design and build a door lock system that allows users to unlock a door via face recognition, through a camera implanted on the door. In this methods chapter, we will discuss how we detailed the process of implementing this mechanism. We started our research by confirming the need of potential users for such a system and then followed a modified version of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) approach to design and build a door lock system.
